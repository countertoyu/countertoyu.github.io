			<h1 class = "center">The Goddess Sekmet Comes to Life from Ra's Eye</h1>
			<p>Ra is now very old and has changed quite a lot, and already his decrepitude<sup>1</sup> is the main subject of conversation all over the country.</p>
			<p>"Our majesty has grown very old, his bones are made of silver, his flesh of gold, and his hair from lapis lazuli...<sup>2</sup>"</p>
			<p>But some not very nice things were also said about his pathetic condition, and on hearing them, Ra ordered his servants.</p>
			<p>Ra: "Have the divine Nile sent for, as well as all the gods of creation, Shou, Tafnouit, and Sibou, and don't forget the mothers and fathers who were with me when I was in the Nou, the chaos nothingness beside the gods. In fact call Nou, the chaos itself, along with the others."</p>
			<p>The council of the gods, which looked like a huge family gathering, took place in the presence of Ra's ancestors as well as his descendants who were eaiting, floating in the river for the moment of their birth<sup>3</sup>. His children Shou and Tafnouit, as well as his grandchildren Sibou and Nouit were all there.</p>
			<p>Ra: "Oh Nou, from whom I came to life, and all you gods of the past, the men who came to life from my eye have spoken against me. I have called you all here to ask you what you think of my plan to destroy them all.</p>
			<p>Nou, the most ancient of the gods, spoke up to ask that the culprits be judged and sentenced before punishing them. However, Ra underlined that the men, aware of what was in stock for them, would not wait to be judged, but instead hide in the desert, for there the gods of Egypt could no longer go after them. That would be their ultimate, unreachable refuge.</p>
			<p>The council of gods thus decided in light of Ra's fears that the men would be massacred without a trial. The divine eye was chosen as the executioner</p>
			<p>Ra's eye took the shape of the goddess Sekmet, who rushed at the men.</p>
			<p>However, after some time, Ra, who didn't want the human race to be destroyed, but just wanted the men to be punished for not respecting him, put a stop to the genocide.</p>
			<p>But the goddess Sekmet, who has tasted blood, refused to obey and continued to kill the men. That is why the Egyptians later called her Sekmet the powerful lioness, who kills without pity, and because of this she is represented by a lion's head on a female body.</p>
			<p>Taking advantage of the night, Ra set a trap for her in order to put an end to her madness.</p>
			<p>Ra: "Some of you should quickly go to Elephantine<sup>4</sup> and from there bring me some mandragores<sup>5</sup> of the best king along with huge pomegranates<sup>6</sup>."</p>
			<p>Some mandragores were crushed along with beer and some pomegranate juice. To the mixture human blood was added. The whole mixture was then poured into thousands of pots<sup>7</sup> made of earth. Then Ra himself checked whether the drug was effective.</p>
			<p>Ra: "It is perfect. With this mixture I shall save my men from the goddess' fury."</p>
			<p>At that moment, right in the middle of then ight, Ra brings forth the daylight, in order to be able to see everything clearly. So, all oveer the ground, he pours the magical mixture he had prepared so carefully.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile the goddess Sekmet, was getting ready for another rampage<sup>8</sup>, and as she saw the flood, her face lit up with joy at the prospect of having more blood to drink. Thirsty, she drank, and her heart was appeased, and thus satisfied she no longer thought of killing men.</p>
			<p>However, Ra thought that she was likely to become violent when she was again thirsty, so every new year he prepared as many beer mugs<sup>9</sup> as there were priestesses of the sun. From that moment on, men have offered flagoons<sup>10</sup> of beer to the goddess on the day of her feast.</p>

			<p>1. decrepitude - condition of being worn out by old age;</p>
			<p>2. lapis lazuli - blue semiprecious stone;</p>
			<p>3. This is an interesting metaphor for time. In modern terms, "the world is a hologram, the times appearing different in the hologram/dream, but not being so in the divine realm, or realms, realms which are aware of the truth at all times";</p>
			<p>4. Elephantine - city in ancient Egypt;</p>
			<p>5. mandragore - plant used for magical rituals;</p>
			<p>6. pomegranate - a species of fruit filled with small feeds;</p>
			<p>7. pot - a round vessel;</p>
			<p>8. rampage - a violent, cruel behavior;</p>
			<p>9. mug - a heavy drinking cup;</p>
			<p>10. flagons - a sort of bottle.</p>
			<p>This story acts as a continuation to the story "Ra, God of The Sun". The story "Ra Thinks About Getting Some Rest" then follows after this story forming, together, the tale of Ra.<br>
