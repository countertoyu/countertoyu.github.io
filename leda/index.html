			<p>Somewhere in the mountains of Peloponesia there flowed a river called Eurotas. By this river there grow beautiful trees and flowers; the landscape is magnificent. It was there where the swans<sup>1</sup> came to rest; it was in fact the ideal spot to rest and dream. Plants with large leaves created the perfect atmosphere and also provided shade<sup>2</sup> from the summer heat.</p>
			<p>Leda, wife of Tyndareus, loves that place and regularly goes there to rest. After swimming in the river, she usually lies down completely naked in the sun.</p>
			<p>These scenes are noticed by Zeis who looks for a way to get close to her without scaring her. Since all Leda sees around her are the swans, the king of the Olympus becomes a swan and approaches her the lady without being noticed. With the help of his old friend Aphrodite<sup>3</sup>, he succeeds, for Aphrodite turns into an eagle and chases the poor swan right into the arms of the beautiful Leda. She feels pity for the poor animal which she protects on her chest - much to the pleasure of Zeus. From their union two huge eggs were left by the shore of the river. Helen and Pollux hatched<sup>4</sup> from the first one and Castor and Clytemnestra from the second.</p>
