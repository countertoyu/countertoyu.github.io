			<h1 class = "center">Sources of The Nile</h1>
			<p>Meter, who was the deputy<sup>1</sup> king of Nubia was what everybody cconsidered to be a noble man. He lived in Elephantine and was charged to take care of Knemou's property.</p>
			<p>Knemou was a prosperous and powerful man, master of the source of the Nile, which was only known by his priests. It was said that the Nile took it's source from an abyss formed by boiling water which was locaed in-between two large rocks: Crephi and Morphi. At that spot there is a hole so deep that nobody has ever touched the bottom.</p>
			<p>In the nineteenth year of his reign, Pharaoh Zeser sends a letter to Meter informing him that great disasters had been caused by the fact that for seven seasons, the waters of the Nile had not risen to their usual height. The earth was dry and produced nothing, leaving the population in an unprecedented state of despair. The king therefore sought some information.</p>
			<p>Zeser's letter: "Where is the source of the Nile? Which god has control over it? Our life depends on him, and if he doesn't bless us, we are doomed<sup>2</sup>."</p>
			<p>Meter lost no time in going to the Pharaoh, and there he informed him about the situation.</p>
			<p>Meter, deputy king: "There is a town along the river where the Nile has it's source. It is an ancient town which dates back to the origin of the universe. It is called Abou. It is also called the city of the beginning, for it is the country that was created before all other countries.</p>
			<p>In this old city there is an old gigantic staircase, on which Ra rested after creating mankind. That is where the two caves which give the Nile it's source lie. That is the place where the flood which submerges the earth takes it's roots. It is there that the whole world comes to life, and it simply happens like this: the god of the Nile wakes up after a long rest and opens the door to free the water which then brings joy to mankind.</p>
			<p>The god of the Nile is called Shou, and he makes sure that all over Egypt everyone receives what he deserves. In the sanctuaries he is worshipped and offered a considerable amount of treasures as a sign of gratitude.</p>
			<p>Meter had thus explained to the Pharaoh the basic things about his kingdom. Enlightened<sup>3</sup>, the Pharaoh wanted to go on a pilgrimage to Knemou's temple.</p>
			<p>In this temple he fell asleep and dreamt he had a conversation with Knemou.</p>
			<p>Knemou: "I am Knemou, god of the creation; with my hands I've made man as he is today. I've given him strong limbs and a heart, but human beings are very ungrateful. The stones which should have been used to build a temple for me are untouched. Kings and commoners have forgotten that I am the creator, the almighty, the master of the universe. It is I who give health as well as the waters that enable life to go on."</p>
			<p>Knemou: "For you I shall allow the water to flow and put an end to the drought. Your people will be happy for they will have even more water than they wish for."</p>
			<p>With these promising words in mind, the Pharaoh awoke, filled with hope. He left the sanctuary, and wasting no time he passed a law through which he made donations to the temple.</p>
			<p>A note was sent to every peasant, fisherman, and hunter regarding the nature of the gifts they were supposed to offer to the temple. He also requested that every peasant politely salute Knemou.</p>
			<p>From this understanding between the Pharaoh and Knemou, not a spring has passed by without the Nile spreading it's waters all over Egypt. In anticipation of the fruitful harvest, the people celebrated continuously. They adore and worship the Nile, their live-giving god.</p>
