			<p>Acrisius, king of Argos, decides to consult the oracle about what his future looks like, but it can be very dangerous to try and know one's destiny.</p>
			<p>"Be careful of your grand-son, who will take both your life and your throne", says the oracle.</p>
			<p>At first he has no worries since he has no grand-son and his daughter is not married, but after some thought he starts to get worried and to be sure he decides to lock up his daughter in a brazen<sup>1</sup> tower. Zeus does not appreciate the way the beautiful girl is treated and has a lot of pity for her, so he visits her in the form of a shower of gold and fathers Perseus.</p>
			<p>Acrisius has thus just become a grand-father, and this situation was not without risks, as we will see later on.</p>
