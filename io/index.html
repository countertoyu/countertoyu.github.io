			<h1 class = "center">Io</h1>
			<p>Hera has a very strong character and is also very jealous, which probably explains Zeus'a numerous adventures. Maybe Zeus is going too far, maybe he is taking advantage of the whole situation. It is hard to say. Anyway, the divine household has more and more problems, and Hera decides to watch Zeus even closer. She notices the keen interest her husband has for Io, the daughter of Inachus. Zeus very shrewdly<sup>1</sup> understands that Hera is watching, so he once again uses metamorphosis and transforms her into a heifer<sup>2</sup> to deceive the jealous Hera.
			<p>Hera no longer sees Io and now she instead notices a heifer she had not seen before. She has her doubts, and to find out what is really happening she pretends to be firendly to the heifer. Zeus notices this and offers her the heifer as a gift. Now that Hera has the animal, she wants to make sure it doesn't get away; so she has the hundred-eyed Argus watch over the heifer. Argus sees in all directions simultaneously and nothing can escape his attention. However, Zeus is not happy with Hera's scheme so he sends his faithful servant Hermes to take care of this uncomfortable situation.</p>
			<p>Hermes has been asked to get rid of Argus and free Io. How will he achieve this task? Hermes decides to go and meet Argus. The latter asks him to go away as he senses some kind of imminent danger, but Hermes, quite stubbornly, does not obey. Instead he comes closer to him, takes his flute and starts playing. Argus is thrilled by the sound of the melody, for he has never heard anything so fantastic, and as he listens with all his eyes concentrated on Hermes, he wonders where tthe wonderful instrument actually comes from. He asks Hermes where the instrument comes from, and the shrewd god promises to tell him later on, even to let him have it. However, Hermes is very cunning and as soon as the hundred-eyed Argus falls asleep his head is cut off by Hermes.</p>
			<p>Now Io is ready to flee. When Hera hears this news she is quite angry, but since she can do nothing against Zeus, she sends a gadfly to sting Io and makes her wander around the earth until she reaches Egypt.</p>
			<p>In Egypt Zeus restores her to human form and she bears him a son, Epaphus, known as Isis by the Egyptians.</p>
			<p>As for Argus, Hera planted his numerous eyes on the tail of her favorite bird, the peacock.</p>
