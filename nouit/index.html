			<h1 class = "center">Nouit's Five Children</h1>
			<p>Ra was very angry when he was informed of the wedding between Nouit, goddess of the sky, and Sibou, the god of the earth. He was so angry that he cast a charm on Nouit so as to stop her from having any children, in any month of the year whatsoever. Ra had cast this charm on her for having married Sibout without his consent.</p>
			<p>However, the god Thot, who was sorry for her, had just won a game of draughts against the moon. After more victories, he now had the moon at his service, so he asked for a part of his light, just enough to create five whole days.</p>
			<p>These five days were not supposed to belong to any of the months<sup>1</sup>, and they didn't belong to the year or the calendar. In this period, Nouit could give birth to five children, thus escaping from her father's ban.</p>
			<p>The first child was Osiris; he was handsome and tall, and he was handed over to Pamiles of Thebes who was to educate and prepare him for an extraordinary destiny.</p>
			<p>Deep inside, Ra was also happy, because for some time now he had forgiven Nouit.</p>
			<p>The second child was Harveris and the third Seth. Then on the fourth day came Isis, followed by Nephthys on the fifth day.</p>
			<p>Osiris grew up and got married to his sister. In those days, the Egyptians were still somewhat barbaric, devouring each other and feeding on the fruits of the land and having no personal skills.</p>
			<p>Osiris taught them how to recognize the plants they could feed on, wheat, wine and corn. He also taught them how to sow and harvest. In front of others, and for the firs ttime, he drank a glass of wine and beer much to everybody's pleasure and surprise. He taught his people to recognise different metals asas to work with the minerals found inside the earth.</p>
			<p>In the meantime Isis explained to them that one shouldn't eat his fellow men. She treated them and cured their illnesses, and chased their demons away<sup>2</sup>. She taught them the ways and rituals of family life, and how to stay at home with a wife and children.
			<p>With Thot's help Osiris gave an idea to mankind of the divine science that enabled one to understand more. Thot taught them all about the signs he had invented to note conversations as well as to keep the formular of which the whole Universe is the subject. From then on mankind discovered something marvellous: writing. With this they also learned how to look at the sky and understand the stars.</p>
			<p>After being a good and quiet King, Osiris decided to become a great conqueror. He thus left for Asia, leaving his kingdom in the care of Isis. He had with him a large army, and Thot, the Ibis<sup>3</sup>, and Anubis, and the jackal<sup>4</sup> also went along with him.</p>
			<p>Osiris was a special kind of conqueror, as he used neither violence nor weapons. It was through kindness and persuasion that he won people. His words were charming, and they touched the soul of whoever was listening to him. Everywhere he went, he made a point of pacifying people and teaching all the useful things he had taught the Egyptians. It is during this period that he was called Ounnefer, the good man who dedicated his life to the salvation of mankind. He went to every single country, and it was only after going from one edge of the earth to the other that he returned to the shores of the Nile.</p>
			<p>Not far from Osiris lived his brother, the violent and menacing Seth Typhon. His skin was white, while his head was covered by reddish hair, just like that of a donkey. That is the reason why donkeys were consacrated to him.</p>
			<p>He was wicked and jealous, violent, and moody and, during his brother's absence, he had hoped to become the master of Egypt, but Isis had stopped him, with great pain.</p>

			<p>1. The Egyptian calendar uses 360 days, thus there being twelve months of 30 days each (12*30=300+60=360). To get to 365 days, you need five extra days. One more interesting note is that, then, the calendar is yet another artifact of the ancient base 60 notations - 60 minutes / hour, 60 seconds / minute, 24 hours / day (24 / 2 = 12 = 60 / 5, base 60 was very used because a lot of numbers are divided by 60. The fact that you can divide the day like this and not get very big issues is pretty cool in itself);</br>
			<p>2. Since this website is intended to have a smaller reach, I will add one tiny joke, and also happy idea, if someone wants to draw something and make it valuable not just for being unusual: Isis is the original vtuber;</br>
			<p>3. Ibis - sacred bird in ancient Egypt [hence written with a capital "I"];</br>
			<p>4. jackal - wild dog.</p>
