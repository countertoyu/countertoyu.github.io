			<h1 class = "center">Osiris' Resurrection</h1>
			<p>Isis had taken refuge in Bouto, the town where she had been born, in order to escape from Typhon's wickedness. That is where she gave birth to her son, Horus. He was thus able to grow up in a good environment, far away from evil and wickedness.</p>
			<p>However, one day while hunting in the moonlight Seth sees the coffin of Osiris, Isis' brother, where Isis had hidden it. He opened the coffin and recognized Osiris' corpse, so he decided to cut him into fourteen parts so as to destroy all traces of his crime.</p>
			<p>The unfortunate Isis is informed of Seth's crime, and once again she goes after the pieces of Osiris' body. She is able to find all of the pieces except for one which seems to have entered the Nile. Assisted by Nephtys, Horus, Thot, Anubis, and Ibis, she studied the teachings Osiris had left, and discovered the secret that would enable them to bring him back to life. From these secrets, Isis invented the remedy for mortality. Isis thus took what was left of Osiris, embalmed him and created the first eternal mummy. This was possible since Anubis already possessed the knowledge of how to preserve the flesh, and to this, Thot, Isis and Horus added some magical rituals which gave new life.</p>
			<p>Singing, Isis kissed the mummy's feet -</p>
			<p>Isis: "Come back home, your enemies are not here! Come to the one who loves you, Ounnefer, don't go away from me. Men and gods miss you and mourn you every day, and I call you, crying as loud as the sky...</p>
			<p>Next to the mummy the gods built a statue an exact image of Osiris alive, and with this they uttered such powerful formulas that the statue could hear, speak, talk and listen, seated in front of a table filled with all the pure and good things given by the heavens and created on earth.</p>
			<p>Raised from the dead, Osiris could have once again lived among men, as he even appeared to his loyal followers, but he preffered to stay away from the crowd. He preferred the quiet and peaceful life in the valleys.</p>
			<p>It is said that he later crossed the sea somewhere between Byblos and the Phoenician territory<sup>1</sup> and left for the heavens where his eternal kingdom now lies.</p>
			<br/>

			<hr/>
			<p>1. Modern historians consider Byblos as a part of Pheonicia, but at the time it may have been under the direct control of Egypt.</p>
			<p>This story is the third part of "The Legend of Isis and Osiris", and is continued in the story "Horus".</br>
