			<h1 class = "center">Horus</h1>
			<p>In the region of lake Burlos, not far from Bouto, Isis gave birth to Horus, and for a long time that is where she kept and raised him, far from the wickedness of Seth who had killed his father.</p>
			<p>As a child, Horus walked around naked, for it was very hot in the region of the Nile. Isis fed him just like she fed herself, with grains she usually took from papyrus leaves, and sometimes she had to go right into town to beg for some food for her child.</p>
			<p>However, one night as Isis wandered through the papyrus, she found him lying on the floor unconscious, and the ground was filled with tears which he had shed.</p>
			<p>Full of sorrow once again, Isis let out a deep and inhuman cry. Horus was dead and now there was nobody to protect her from the evil Seth. When the villagers in the surrounding area heard her cry, they all came around, but neither their lamentations nor her ears could change her plight<sup>1</sup>!</p>
			<p>An old woman approached her, and in an attempt to bring her some comfort told her that Horus could be cured.</p>
			<p>Old lady: "He was bitten by a scorpion which was left by Anuab."</p>
			<p>Isis thus bent over the child's chest to see if he was still breathing and saw that there was poison in the wound. Taking her child in her arms she once again let out an unimaginable cry.</p>
			<p>The goddess Nephthys, sister of Osiris and Isis, came to share the sorrow of the goddess, and with her was Selket, goddess of the scorpions. When Nephthys saw the disaster, she asked her sister to seek the help of the mighty Ra. Ra, god of the sun, upon hearing her call stopped his celestial  boat, bringing the earth to a standstil. Thot, who possesses all the possible charms, came out of the boat down to earth.</p>
			<p>Thot: "What has happened, my dear Isis? Is it possible that your child, protected by Ra, could find himself in such a state? Do not worry, for I shall help you. I've left the divine boat to come and cure your son."</p>
			<p>Without wasting any more time he said some invocations, placing his hand over he lifeless body.</p>
			<p>Thot: "Wake up, Horus! Poison go to the ground, for it is the will of the gods that I bring you back to life! Horus, come to life for you must stay alive for your mother."</p>
			<p>A couple of seconds later, the boy came back to life, drying the tears of his mother. Thot had accomplished his mission and thus climbed back into the celestial boat and pursued his journey.</p>
			<p>From one end of the sky to the other the gods cheered, as the miracle had brought lots of joy.</p>
			<p>Horus grew up, leaning to write and understand sacred symbols. Once again, Osiris came to earth and gave weapons to his son in order to prepare him for his upcoming battles.</p>
			<p>Osiris: "What do you consider to be a man's greatest deed?"</p>
			<p>Horus: "To avenge his mother and father against those who have caused them pain." - he answered without hesitation.</p>
			<p>In order to help his son in the course of his battles, Osiris wanted to offer him an animal, so he asked him to choose between a horse and a lion. Horus chose the horse "because a lion is only useful against cowards whereas the horse enables one to chase his enemy<sup>2</sup>".</p>
			<p>After this, Osiris returned to the other world, his mind at peace.</p>
			<p>Horus dedicated himself to the role of the avenger. He put on white sandals and went around the country. He was escorted by the Egyptians who had remained faithful to Osiris. Horus' servants attacked Seth's accomplices without pity and with great vigour. The latter were suprirsed by the attack and transformed themselves into evil creatures. For three days, the battle went on without results. Meanwhile, Isis was impatient and tried to help her son. However, Horus was not pleased by this undesired help and so chased his mother away.</p>
			<p>The war went on without a victor for a good period of time, so finally the gods called both parties in front of a tribunal and asked them to accept Thot as the referee<sup>3</sup>.</p>
			<p>Seth pleaded, contending that Horus could not rightfully be considered as the son of Osiris since he was born after the latter's death.</p>
			<p>Horus on the other hand proved that Seth's reasoning was inconsistent. Thot thus condemned Seth to restitute the part of the inheritance that belonged to Horus. The sentence was ratified by the gods, and Sibou, the ancestor of the rival gods, intervened and divided Egypt in two. Seth was given the valley of the Nile, between Memphis and the first cataract, while Horus received the delta. Sibou's kingdom was thus divided iin two because his children were not able to get along. It was only later on that the Pharaohs united both kingdoms.</p>
			<p>However, Thot's arrangement didn't put an end to the feud, and one of their battles is written all over the walls of the temple of Edfou.</p>
			<p>Defeated, Seth's army retreated to the south where he managed to find refuge, but some of his men could no longer take the pressure and fled to the desert of Nubia. Horus chased them all the way to the desert and returned to Edfou to celebrate his victory.</p>
			<p>From this point on, Horus became the uncontested master of Egypt, anf after him his descendents reign: Menes, who was the first king of the dynasty, followed by the Pharaohs and the other Egyptian dynasties.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Seth didn't die and the battle continued between Horus, god of light, and Seth, god of darkness. Men have always celebrated the victory of the powers of light against those of darkness.</p>

			<p>1. sorrowful condition;</p>
			<p>2. The Egyptians, in the bronze age and potentially the previous copper age also, used horse chariots to conduct warfare. This was a kind of system where a professional army lived and trained to use said chariots, and acted as the defense of the state. The idea of a professional army would, however, end, as these soldiers required a decade or more to train, time which was far from available as crisis hit Egypt.</p>
			<p>This is a bit outside the scope of our story, but it's very interesting to note, so - the theory I find most plausible as to the bronze age collapse is the theory of systems' collapse. The problem with bronze age societies was not their complexity - after all, break down these societies and you'll pretty much be left with stone age civilisation and little villages, as happened initially after the collapse. These villages, the less connected with other villages, are far more easy to break, in fact. If a really bad flood happens and brings down the houses, it takes time to find materials and rebuild, while trying to survive. The village might never rebuild. Or, if a drought happens, or you're just not able to get enough food.</p>
			<p>This is actually the case of the Saharan civilisation of Garama, which experienced a golden age, to the extent that the Romans called the entire area from the middle of modern Libya - going north to south - all the way west of Ethiopia. In North America, that would be like going from Portland to the Yucutan peninsula. In Europe, that's like going from Manchester, in Britain, to Izmir, on the Aegean coast of Turkey. All that while including, in both examples, other areas too, in the European example going down to the Pyrenees, between France and Spain; Rome, Naples, in Italy; Athens in Greece, in the south, and Krakow in Poland, in the north, for good measure.</p>
			<p>This civilization of the Garamantes, however, fades into obscurity with the fall of Rome and reduction in trans-saharan commerce. Theories as to their decline by the time of the Arab conquests to a much smaller town of Garama, and eventually their disappearance, point to several factors, but the one that seems quite probable is that the Garamantes were unable, with less power, to maintain the slaves needed for their irrigation, and so had to rely on less efficient at the time well irrigation. Thus, their population went down, and if you add some possible internal difficulties, or simply a migration, it's easy to see how Garama may have ended.</p>
			<p>Thus, the theory of systems' collapse is that larger systems do collapse with more difficulty, however that they do collapse given enough pressure. The adding of several crises, such as is theorized to have happened in the bronze age; often a combination of internal and external pressures.</p>
			<p>Say, if a group of peoples raid Greece, and there ally with local groups, as it seems some of the sea peoples were from Greece. Then, they raid the other civilisations. Add in a conflict, and the countries are beginning to be overwhelmed, so they requisition food and resources from a people that were already dissatisfied, perhaps, about something at the time.</p>
			<p>The dissatisfaction grows into a revolt, and there is now simply too much pressure. The army is running out of trained men to use the difficult chariot system of the time, and is becoming incapable of defending the state.</p>
			<p>The central government scales back to defend a more limited area, but eventually, it too collapses under the pressure. People retreat into more elevated places. This is, yes, one of the many potential origins of the story of the flood, perhaps, although we don't really know.</p>
			<p>It is thus complexity which often gives us the things we love, and a world where survival isn't necessary. It is not complexity that ruins civilizations, but often war and greed. A people united can easily deal with any sickness, but a tired and weary people will fall prey then to simply a deepening of the hopelessness and sorrow that they have given in to, often unknowingly, or without knowing the greater picture.</p>
			<p>Thus, we get stories, during medieval other events of men whipping themselves while begging for forgiveness from God, when it is not God that caused the suffering, but either an opportunity for growth and choice, or an insideous hurting of another and enslaving of one's fellow men because of greed, which comes back to haunt the one doing such acts. As such, complexity, used to create joy and wonder is not evil, but can in fact be freeing from the business of survival onto a more prosperous plane of creating a life you love, and enjoying the delight of life in oneself and others;</p>
