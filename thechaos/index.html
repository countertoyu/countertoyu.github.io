			<p>Before the world came to exist, there was nothing, nothing but an uneven mass of disorganized matter, confusing and absurd. There was nothing in any particular order, left was right and right was left. It was the original chaos. It couldn't have been the home of the gods.</p>
			<p>Luckily great powers will intervene, powers completely unknown, but which will have a dramatic effect on the order of things.</p>
			<p>These powers consider, rightly, that the chaos can no longer go on and decide to put everything in a more convenient order.</p>
			<p>The sky is formed with it's stars and the seas surround the newly created earth, and the whole thing is covered by light and air. This is what might be known as the original conception of the Universe.</p>
			<p>Now let us place our mythological characters on sea, land and air. Let us give life to our mythological characters.</p>

			<p>1. chaos - Concept of unconscious change, as opposed to conscious change; Notable is also the philosophy that all things have some kind of being, though not as intelligent, not as able to express itself as humans. Thus, "nothing is chaotic". This becomes stranger, as we will see, when speaking of "The Chaos".</br>
