			<h1 class = "center">Osiris' Death</h1>
			<p>In Memphis a big feast was organised in order to celebrate Osiris' return. It was during this celebration, that Seth seized the throne with the help his accomplices.</p>
			<p>He had measured Osiris' height, and had built a wooden box of the same length. He then ordered some men to carry the wooden case into the banquet hall during the ceremony, and everybody stood in admiration in front of the beautiful object.</p>
			<p>Noticing that everybody was charmed and pleased with his masterpiece, Seth offered to give the box to whoever would fit inside. So, one after the other, they all entered the coffin, but there always remained some space left. Nobody seemed to fit in perfectly. On his turn, Osiris entered the coffin, and immediately after he lay down, Seth's accomplices closed the coffin and nailed it tight. Without a second thought, they then threw the coffin into the Nile where it disappeared immediately in the tidde.</p>
			<p>As the news of this horrible crime spread around Egypt, Osiris' friends took refuge in the bodies of various animals in order to escape from Seth's wickedness.</p>
			<p>Isis was terribly afflicted by this unexpected and great loss, and in her sorrow she tore her clothes out and cut all her hair as a sign of mourning. She had escaped from the room where the wicked Seth had locked her up, and was now looking for the coffin<sup>1</sup>.
			<p>On her way she meets Thot, the almighty God of Truth, who tells her:</p>
			<p>Thot: "Oh goddess Isis, be strong and confide in me, for I will help you and guide your steps. This is what the future has in store for you. You will have a son, who will be handsome and strong, and will avenge his father and become the most powerful king in the world.</p>
			<p>But, at that moment, Isis thought not of Horus, who was not yet born, but rather thought about finding Osiris. She was able to leave Seth's palace, and thanks to Thot she was escorted by seven scorpions who surrounded her and were to bite anybody that approached her.</p>
			<p>Two of the scorpions went ahead, while two others were by her sides and the other three followed up behind. They had all received strict orders from Thot; they were to talk with nobody, and would have to walk with their eyes fixed to the ground so as to avoid the snakes which were controlled by Seth.</p>
			<p>As Isis entered the town of Pa-Sin, the women standing by their houses were all surprised to see the strande procession. One of these women, Usa, who was afraid Isis might want to ask for hospitality, slammed her door on the goddess. Tefen, the chief of the scorpions, with his tail filled with venom slid inside the wicked woman's house and stang her child. This sting set the house on fire, and there was no water to extinguish the fire, and the old Usa started panicking, running around the streets of the town, begging for help at the thought that her son would die. Unfortunately, nobody answered her call, for nobody wanted to come out.</p>
			<p>Feeling pity for the child, Isis helped the wicked woman<sup>2</sup>.</p>
			<p>Isis: "Come here, I possess the breath of life, for my father<sup>3</sup> showed me how to chase away the demon of death!"</p>
			<p>Isis thus stretched out her hands over the child's head while she said some incantations, and all of a sudden it started raining. The child was thus saved, and the house stopped burning with Isis' help.</p>
			<p>Isis was able to finally find refuge in the house of a charitable old woman called Taha, who was a neighbor of Usa's. Being sorry for her wicked attitude, Usa filled Taha's house with gifts for the goddess Isis.</p>
			<p>After a while Isis once again continued her search for Osiris, but all along the way she could hardly find anyone to give her proper information. However, one day she noticed a couple of kids playing by the sea, and so she asked them:</p>
			<p>Isis: "Little ones, did you see some men carrying a long and heavy coffin pass here?"</p>
			<p>Little ones: "Yes, we did indeed see them."</p>
			<p>They headed towards the delta of the Nile going to Tanis and that's where they threw the coffin.</p>
			<p>She once again continued her journey with her scorpions, heading for Byblos where the coffin had been thrown. They sought in vain for some time; for when the coffin, carried by the waves to the shores of Byblos, had become entangled in the reeds that grew at the edge of the water, the divine power that dwelt in the body of Osiris<sup>4</sup> imparted such strength to the shrub that it grew into a mighty tree, enclosing in it's trunk the coffin of the god. The tree was then ccut off by the king's carpenter who built one of the palace columns with it.</p>
			<p>Isis upon discovering the situation decided to take action. So, one morning, as the queen's maids headed to the fountain, they saw the despondent woman sitting alone in tears.</p>
			<p>They engaged in conversation and Isis offered to help them do their hair, as well as share with them some of her divine perfume.</p>
			<p>When the maids returned to the palace, their queen noticed the change in her maids, and asked that Isis be brought to her. The queen kept her in her court, and even trusted her to the extent of leaving her child in her care. The Queen Nemanou, who was the wife of King Malacandra, didn't have the slightest idea as to Isis' real identity, and she ignored all the strange techniques the governess<sup>5</sup> used to make the child happy.</p>
			<p>For instance, to feed the young boy all she had to do was put her finger inside his mouth. However, one night Nemanou went to see what was happening in her child's room and there, to her great surprise, she saw the child sleeping alone and surrounded by huge flames and seven scorpions. People came from all directions as they heard the queen screaming. With a movement of her hand, Isis put out the fire and the scorpions disappeared, and to the queen she said sadly:</p>
			<p>Isis: "You didn't trust me! Your son will never be immortal! Every night I put him in fire in order to purify him from his earthly elements, but now I can no longer do that!"</p>
			<p>The queen was sad, while the king was honoured to have received a goddess in his kingdom, and asked her what he could do to show her his gratitude. He wasn't aware that every night Isis turned into a bird and flew around the palace, looking for a way to take one of the columns in which she believed Osiris' coffin was to be found.</p>
			<p>Isis is pleased with the king's proposition, and wastes no time in making it known that she would like to have the huge column. Malacandra immediately calls his carpenters, who cut down the tree in no time.</p>
			<p>After withdrawing Osiris' coffin, she put perfume on the stem<sup>6</sup> of the column which she handed over to the king and his subjects, and from then on in Byblos the acacia<sup>7</sup> became the object of respect and worship.</p>
			<p>So, carrying the coffin of her dear brother-husband, Osiris, Isis heads for Egypt<sup>8</sup>, and in a solitary place not far from a locality called Bouto she places it in safety.</p>

			<p>1. This story is somewhat familiar to the story of Mario and princess Peach, although there the gender roles are reversed. It is Mario saving Peach, the prince saving the princess, rather than Isis <b>searching</b> for Osiris. Searching, so far. Peach did not die in Mario games;</p>
			<p>2. Here we see an important story. Isis, Osiris and Horus are in most stories very similar to the Christian trinity. If you pay attention until the end of this story, you will notice the similarities, although in this trinity all of them are incarnate on Earth and helping others as they can. This becomes even more intriguing when you consider that Jesus is said to have been taken to Alexandria early in his life to escape pogroms, and is said to have been offered a position as teacher of spiritual truth in Alexandria if he left his family at another point, an offer he [if this offer did truly happen] declined.</p>
			<p>Jesus is also said to have spent a certain time around the Mediterranean, in Persia, and in India, in an attempt to understand the teachings of the age, and later, in his tour of the Mediterranean, the peoples and jobs of his age. It is possible that one of Jesus's intentions may have been to bring Egyptian tantra to Hebrew lands, who at the time followed a version of religion that was very distorted (following the difficulties the Hebrews faced during Moses' time). (e.g. the poor deserve their suffering, those that get strong get so because God favors it; You are your body, you must preserve your body well and bury it well for the time of your body's resurrection; etc.);</p>
			<p>3. Sibou, God of Earth;</p>
			<p>4. You may note the Biblical idea of "The "I am" power dwelling in the body";</p>
			<p>5. governess - woman who looks after children;</p>
			<p>6. stem - the main vertical part of a plant;</p>
			<p>7. acacia - tree of the mimosa family, cultivated for it's perfume;</p>
			<p>8. There are references online of king Malacander of Byblos, in Greek, also known as Jebeil in Arabic, located in modern Lebanon, then the civilization, and later Roman province, of Phoenicia.</p>
			<p>This story is the second part of "The Legend of Isis and Osiris"</br>
