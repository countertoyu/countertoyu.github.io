			<h1 class = "center">Ra Thinks About Getting Some Rest</h1>
			<p>Time has gone by, and one day Ra thinks about getting some rest.</p>
			<p>Ra: "My heart is too tired for me to stay amongst mortals." - he said to the council of gods, which was surprised, and replied:</p>
			<p>Ra: "How can you talk about being tired, when you have just won a great battle?"</p>
			<p>Ra was determined to abandon the kingdom where they had already started to spread rumors about him, so he called Nou, the chaos.</p>
			<p>Ra: "My limbs<sup>1</sup> are in bad shape, and for the first time in my life I'm feeling weak. I want to go away from here, go to a place where nobody would find me."</p>
			<p>Nouit thought that Ra's son would occupy his father's throne with dignity, and in order to give Ra a refuge where nobody would find him, Nouit decided to put an end to his work, to put an end to the creation of the world.</p>
			<p>Nou: "Shou, you must act on your father's behalf. You must accomplish his wishes. Nouit, my girl, take you father on your back and hold him in suspension above the earth."</p>
			<p>Nouit quietly obeys, transforming herself into a cow, after which she placed Ra on her back.</p>
			<p>When the men who had survived the massacre<sup>4</sup> came to pay their respect to Ra, they didn't find him in his palace, but instead they saw him on a cow's back.</p>
			<p>Men: "Wait 'till tomorrow, oh Ra, great master, for we shall take care of your enemies and all those who have dared to insult you.</p>
			<p>Ra left the cow's back and entered his castle, and precisely at that moment, the earth was covered by darkness.</p>
			<p>The next day, when the earth was once again covered with the morning light, the men came out carrying bows and arrows and started shooting at the god's enemies.</p>
			<p>This was the beginning of what would be known as the bloody sacrifice, and it was put into action to punish those who would offend the god - and things considered so, offenses, were numerous. It was agreed that, in order to make things better, the culprit had to be sacrificed.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Ra had a lot of affection for men, his creatures, so he decided later on that the victims be replaced by animals on the condition that these animals would be sacrificed by priests who would say magical words so that the animals would replace the men.</p>
			<p>After this reconciliation with his creatures, Ra once again climbed onto the back of the divine cow, but the cow couldn't withstand his weight and asked to be supported.</p>
			<p>Ra: "My son Shou, go under Nouit and try to keep her from falling."</p>
			<p>Shou obeyed, and Nouit immediately felt much better, for her stomach was now supported by four pillars<sup>3</sup>, which were guarded by Horus the hawk<sup>4</sup> in the south, Seth in the north, Thot in the west, and Sapdi in the east. It is the celestial canopy, and by the same token the universe now had a sky where Ra hung some stars so as to shed some light during the night. Thus the god Ra, the almighty, decided to organize the new world he discovered while sitting on top of a cow.</p>
